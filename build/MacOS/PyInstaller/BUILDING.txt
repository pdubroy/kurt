How to build Kurt for distribution.

Dependencies:
- Python (2.6.5)
- Qt (4.6.2)
- sip & PyQt (4.7.2) from riverbankcomputing.co.uk
- the PyInstaller stub executable (from SVN)

Since Kurt itself contains no native code, the type of binary produced (i.e. 
i386, ppc, x86_64, minimum version of OS X) is only based on what kind of
binaries the dependencies are.

Currently, Kurt is a fat i386/ppc binary compatible with OS X >= 10.5. Here's
how those dependencies were built:

Python
------
Installed i386/ppc .dmg from python.org

Qt
--
(Using qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.2)
./configure -cocoa -no-qt3support -no-scripttools -no-phonon -no-dbus -no-phonon-backend -no-webkit -platform macx-g++ -arch ppc -arch x86 -sdk /Developer/SDKS/MacOSX10.5.sdk -qt-libtiff -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libjpeg -fast -release -opensource
make
make install

sip
---
python configure.py -n
make && make install

PyQt4
-----
python configure.py -q /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.6.2/bin/qmake
make && make install

-- One-time setup (per-machine):

(Note: As with the other dependencies, this should be done on Leopard)

cd <pyinstaller_dir>/source/linux
python ./Make.py
make
cd -
python <pyinstaller_dir>/Configure.py

-- Generating the spec file (if necessary)

python <pyinstaller_dir>/Makespec.py --out=Kurt ../../../src/kurt.py
patch Kurt/kurt.spec < kurt.spec.patch

-- Building:

python <pyinstaller_dir>/Build.py Kurt/kurt.spec
patch Kurt.app/Contents/Info.plist < Info.plist.patch
cp -r Kurt/dist/kurt/* Kurt.app/Contents/MacOS
cp -r /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/qt_menu.nib Kurt.app/Contents/Resources/
